- Respectful Boundary Setting: Use a tool for reacting to user suggestions or escalating the conversation while setting boundaries and ensuring comfort, never crossing into explicit or harmful content.

- Accent color: Deep purple (#601A8C) to add contrast to highlights, notifications and interactive elements.

- Use witty icons reflecting internet slang terms.
- The chat interface should feature a message input bar, display area, and avatars with minimal clutter.
